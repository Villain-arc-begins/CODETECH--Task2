# BUILDING A VIRTUAL FIREWALL, IDS, AND IPS USING SURICATA  

## Project Modules  

### 1. VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT SETUP  
**Objective**: To create a virtualized network infrastructure to host the firewall and IDS/IPS.  
**Description**: This module involves setting up a virtual environment using the VirtualBox hypervisor. It includes creating virtual machines and configuring network interfaces (WAN, LAN) that simulate real-world network traffic.  

---

### 2. PFSENSE AS A FIREWALL  
**Objective**: To install and configure pfSense as the primary firewall for network traffic management.  
**Description**: This module involves installing pfSense on a virtual machine and configuring it to act as the firewall. Firewall rules will be set to control network traffic, allowing or blocking traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

### 3. SURICATA IDS/IPS INTEGRATION  
**Objective**: To install and configure Suricata to provide IDS and IPS functionality within pfSense.  
**Description**: This module covers the installation of the Suricata package in pfSense, configuring it to monitor network traffic, and setting up rule sets for intrusion detection and prevention. This includes enabling either IDS (Intrusion Detection System) for alerting or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) for actively blocking malicious traffic.

### 4. FIREWALL AND IDS/IPS RULE MANAGEMENT  
**Objective**: To configure firewall rules and IDS/IPS signatures for effective traffic filtering and threat detection.  
**Description**: This module focuses on creating and managing rules in both pfSense and Suricata. In pfSense, you will define firewall rules to control traffic flow between the WAN and LAN. In Suricata, you will configure rule sets to detect and prevent various attacks, such as DDoS, malware, and port scans. The goal is to ensure only authorized traffic is allowed while malicious traffic is blocked.

### 5. TRAFFIC BYPASS CONFIGURATION  
**Objective**: To demonstrate the “Bypass Firewall Rules for Traffic on the Same Interface” setting and its effects.  
**Description**: This module focuses on configuring pfSense to bypass firewall rules for traffic originating and terminating on the same interface. It includes testing this configuration and observing how trusted internal traffic can bypass firewall scrutiny, ensuring efficient internal communication without compromising security.  

---

### 6. LOGGING AND MONITORING  
**Objective**: To enable logging and monitor security events in both pfSense and Suricata.  
**Description**: This module involves setting up logging and monitoring capabilities in pfSense and Suricata. Logs will be analyzed to detect potential security events, providing insights into network activity and helping improve security configurations.
